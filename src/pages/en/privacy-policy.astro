  <p>
    In compliance with the provisions of Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 27 April 2016 on the protection of natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data, as well as all other applicable data protection legislation, the WEBSITE OWNER hereby informs you of the following:
  </p>

  <h2>Who is the data controller?</h2>
  <p>
    The data controller is the WEBSITE OWNER, whose identifying details can be found in section 1 of the LEGAL NOTICE.
  </p>

  <h2>What purposes do we process your personal data for?</h2>
  <p>
    The WEBSITE OWNER will process the information provided by the user through the Website for the purpose of managing the provision of the requested services and the related administrative procedures, as well as periodically sending newsletters, commercial communications about services, events and news related to the professional activity of the WEBSITE OWNER when the user so authorises, and to assess the user's candidacy in the event that CVs are collected through the website.
  </p>

  <h2>How long will your data be retained?</h2>
  <p>
    Personal data will be retained for as long as the user does not request its deletion and, in any case, for the number of years necessary to comply with the legal obligations established by applicable legislation, or to address any potential liabilities that may arise.
  </p>

  <h2>What is the legal basis for processing your data?</h2>
  <p>
    The legal basis for the WEBSITE OWNER to process users' data is the consent of the data subject.
  </p>

  <h2>To whom will your data be disclosed?</h2>
  <p>
    As a general rule, data will not be disclosed to third parties, unless required by applicable legislation.
  </p>

  <h2>What are the user's rights?</h2>
  <p>
    The user has the right to obtain confirmation as to whether or not the WEBSITE OWNER is processing personal data concerning them. Users have the right to access their personal data, as well as to request the rectification of inaccurate data or, where appropriate, to request its erasure when, among other reasons, the data is no longer necessary for the purposes for which it was collected.
  </p>
  <p>
    In certain circumstances, the user may request the restriction of the processing of their personal data, in which case the data will only be retained in a blocked state for the exercise or defence of legal claims.
  </p>
  <p>
    In certain circumstances and for reasons related to their particular situation, users may object to the processing of their data. In such cases, the WEBSITE OWNER will cease to process the data, except where there are compelling legitimate grounds, or for the exercise or defence of potential legal claims.
  </p>
  <p>
    In addition to the above rights, the user also has the right to withdraw consent and the right to lodge a complaint with the Supervisory Authority. The necessary information is available at <a href="https://www.aepd.es" target="_blank" rel="noopener">www.aepd.es</a>. Users may exercise their rights by providing a copy of their national identity document or other official identification, by sending an email or by post addressed to the WEBSITE OWNER, whose identifying details can be found in section 1 of the LEGAL NOTICE.
  </p>

  <h2>What security measures do we implement?</h2>
  <p>
    The WEBSITE OWNER will process the User's data at all times in a strictly confidential manner and in compliance with the mandatory duty of secrecy, in accordance with the applicable legislation, adopting the necessary technical and organisational measures to ensure the security of the data and to prevent its alteration, loss, unauthorised processing or access, taking into account the state of technology, the nature of the data stored and the risks to which it is exposed.
